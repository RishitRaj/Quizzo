                <div> To begin your quiz journey, simply click the Start button below. You’ll first be asked to choose a
                    topic from a list of exciting categories. Once selected, the quiz will begin immediately.

                    Questions will be shown one at a time, allowing you to focus on each without distractions. After
                    finishing, your score will be displayed on the results page.
